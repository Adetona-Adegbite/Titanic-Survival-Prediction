# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

This project involves predicting survival on the Titanic for a kaggle compeition using machine learning. I utilized different Data Analysis tools to gain insights and transform the data. I used a RandomForestClassifier classifier and GridSearchCV to optimize the classifierâ€™s hyperparameters, and ended up achieving an accuracy score of 77%.
